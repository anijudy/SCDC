**SCDC** adopts an ENSEMBLE method to integrate deconvolution results
across methods and datasets, giving reference data that are more close to the
bulk RNA-seq data higher weights, implicitly addressing the batch-effect confounding
when multiple scRNA-seq reference sets are available.

## Installation

```r
if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("meichendong/SCDC")
```

## Example 

### Data Input

SCDC takes `ExpressionSet` objects with raw read counts as input. `ExpressionSet` object is based on the package _Biobase_, which mainly stores data matrix (genes by samples), featureData (information about genes), and phenoData (information about samples).
We also enable a quick construction of the ExpressionSet object by the function `getESET()`. Here's a toy example:

```{r, message=F}
library(SCDC)
counts <- matrix(sample(0:500, 25), nrow = 5)
colnames(counts) <- paste("cell",1:5, sep = "")
rownames(counts) <- paste("gene",1:5, sep = "")
counts
fdata <- rownames(counts)
pdata <- cbind(cellname = colnames(counts), subjects = paste("patient", rep(1,5)))
eset <- getESET(counts, fdata = fdata, pdata = pdata)
class(eset)
```

As an illustration of the **SCDC** framework, we analyze the pancreatic islet data as presented in our paper. Three public scRNA-seq datasets from Baron et al.(2017), Segerstolpe et al.(2016) and Xin et al.(2016) are used; a bulk RNA-seq dataset from Fadista et al.(2014) is used in the real data analysis. The processed data is available for download at.

### Descriptive Information of scRNA-seq Data
For each singl-cell dataset with raw counts, we can first explore the demographic information by the visualization function `DemoPlot`. Here, single cells from each subject are summarized by total counts, counts per cell type, and the overall composition. This gives us the general understanding of a dataset. Take scRNA-seq data of healthy subjects from Segerstolpe et al. as an example, we derive the following plot:

```r
ct1 <- c("mediumorchid1","mediumpurple1","lightskyblue","seagreen1","yellow","tan1","azure3")
seger <- readRDS("segerstolpe.rds")
DemoPlot(seger, cluster = "cluster", sample = "sample", select.ct = c("alpha","beta","delta","gamma","ductal","acinar"), Palette = ct1)
```

To make SCDC robust to single-cell clustering, a quality control procedure is performed as a first step to remove cells with questionable cell-type assignments, as well as cells with low library preparation and sequencing quality. Specifically, each single cell is treated as a “bulk” sample and its cell-type composition can be derived by a first-pass run of SCDC. 
The threshold of keeping a single cell from an assigned cluster is chosen as 0.7 in this illustration example. This user-defined threshold should be selected carefully, to achieve the effect of quality control of single cells without obstructing the performance on the downstream analysis. An unproper threshold could potentially lead to filtering out a large proportion of cells from rare cell types. To be conservative, this can be chosen from (0.5,0.7).

```r
seger.qc <- my_qc(seger, ct.varname = "cluster", sample = "sample", scsetname = "Segerstolpe",
                  ct.sub = c("alpha","beta","delta","gamma","ductal","acinar"), qcthreshold = 0.7) 
seger.qc$heatfig
```

Similarly we can perform clustering QC for single cells from only one subject using function `SCDC_qc_ONE()`.


### SCDC on Simulated Data
SCDC allows users to construct pseudo bulk samples in two ways:

- `generateBulk_allcells()` Sum up gene-wise raw read counts per subject, and the true cell-type proportion is consistent with the single cell clustering result.

- `generateBulk_norep()`: Randomly sample single cells from each of the cell types of interest without replacement, and then sum up raw read counts per subject. The cell-type proportions are different from single cell clustering result.

Here, we use the `ExpressionSet` objects after the clustering-QC of each scRNA-seq dataset. Read in the processed objects downloaded from our webpage:

```r
# ExpressionSet objects from the three different scRNA-seq resources
qc.seger <- readRDS("qc_segerstolpe.rds")
qc.baron <- readRDS("qc_baron.rds")
qc.xin <- readRDS("qc_xin.rds")
```

Then create the _pseudo bulk_ samples:
```r
## (1) using all single cells
pseudo.seger <- generateBulk_allcells(qc.seger$sc.eset.qc, ct.varname = "cluster", sample = "sample", ct.sub = c("alpha","beta","delta","gamma","ductal","acinar"))

## (2) using random proportions of single cells
pseudo.seger.rand <- generateBulk_norep(qc.seger$sc.eset.qc, ct.varname = "cluster", sample = "sample", ct.sub = c("alpha","beta","delta","gamma","ductal","acinar"), nbulk = 3)

## we know the true relative proportions for the pseudo bulk samples:
round(pseudo.seger$truep,3)
#>          cluster.id
#> sample.id acinar alpha  beta delta ductal gamma
#>        H1  0.048 0.452 0.167 0.119  0.095 0.119
#>        H2  0.061 0.496 0.200 0.091  0.078 0.074

#>        H5  0.016 0.720 0.175 0.037  0.042 0.011
#>        H6  0.023 0.488 0.105 0.116  0.256 0.012
round(pseudo.seger.rand$true_p,3)
#>      acinar alpha  beta delta ductal gamma
#> H2_1  0.081 0.422 0.225 0.110  0.075 0.087
#> H4_2  0.422 0.130 0.130 0.006  0.266 0.045
#> H4_3  0.322 0.137 0.151 0.007  0.329 0.055
```

The constructed _pseudo bulk_ object includes the true cell-type proportion matrix `pseudo.seger$truep` and the `ExpressionSet` object `pseudo.seger$pseudo_eset`.
